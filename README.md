Battle Buddies - My implementation of the classic OOP project

Explored inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and abstraction.

Player can choose 3 character archetypes: Knight, Mage or Archer. Each one is a subclass of a Character abstract class. They inherit some superclass attributes, but each one has their own set of attributes and methods. The Enemy subclass is also a Character subclass, without special attributes. The superclass attribute values are randomized.

Enough chit-chat -- let's fight!
